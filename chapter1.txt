That's probably true. 
I like talking with people. 
I wonder if speaking with me is boring though.
Since once people talk to me, they'll never do it again. 
But I don't feel like starting a conversation either, since in the direction I ought to look, there are only people who I cannot talk to. 
That's why I look at the sky... 
It's strange how merely observing things can be so handy to kill time. 
It hurts that I get called a weirdo just for making a habit out of it and in the end it just makes me stare at the sky even more.
I've probably always been like this. 
Thinking about it, there's nothing I can do about my passiveness. 
Waiting things out is just my nature. 
I'm sure that... things will get better someday...
