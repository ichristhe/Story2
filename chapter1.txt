If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled, then I wouldn't wish or desire for anything after all. 
The things you're handed on a silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. 
And that is why I'll always keep searching.

Hachiman Hikigaya, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru
